This video covers the t-test, the "workhorse" of parametric data analysis. As a parametric test, the t-test has some data requirements that need to be verified beforehand. To this end, the Kolmogorow-Smirnow-Test or the Shapiro-Test are used to ensure normal distribution and the F-Test for variance homogeneity. These are also presented.
